 Architecture Overview

  The Gemini CLI is a sophisticated AI-powered development assistant built with TypeScript,
  using React/Ink for the terminal UI. It's structured as a monorepo with two main packages:

  - packages/cli: Terminal interface, UI components, and user interactions
  - packages/core: API communication, tool orchestration, and business logic
  - Use pnpm as package manager.

  Key Components

  1. Entry Points & Execution Flow
  - Main entry: scripts/start.js → packages/cli/index.ts → packages/cli/src/gemini.tsx
  - Supports both interactive and non-interactive modes
  - Automatic memory management with heap size optimization
  - Sandbox execution for security

  2. Tool System
  - Comprehensive file operations (read, write, edit, glob, grep)
  - Shell command execution with safety confirmations
  - Web search and fetch capabilities
  - Memory persistence across sessions
  - MCP (Model Context Protocol) for extensibility
  - Theorem extraction and parsing from LaTeX documents

  3. Configuration & Authentication
  - Hierarchical settings system (system → user → workspace → CLI args)
  - Multiple auth methods: OAuth, API key, Vertex AI, Cloud Shell
  - Extension system for adding custom functionality
  - Flexible tool inclusion/exclusion

  4. API Communication
  - Direct integration with Google's Gemini API
  - Streaming responses with real-time output
  - Smart retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Automatic model fallback (Pro → Flash) on quota errors
  - Comprehensive error handling and telemetry

  5. User Interface
  - Rich terminal UI with themes and customization
  - Real-time streaming display
  - Interactive confirmations for destructive operations
  - History management and session persistence
  - Accessibility features

  Key Capabilities

  - Code Understanding: Can read and analyze entire codebases
  - File Operations: Create, edit, and manage files with confirmations
  - Shell Integration: Execute commands safely with user approval
  - Web Research: Access current information and documentation
  - Memory System: Persistent context across sessions
  - Multi-modal: Supports text, images, and various file types
  - Extensibility: MCP protocol for third-party integrations
  - Mathematical Analysis: Extract and analyze theorems from LaTeX documents

  The CLI provides a safe, controlled environment for AI-assisted development tasks with
  robust error handling, security features, and comprehensive tooling capabilities.

 Now I need to implement the following to make it a mathematical assistant:

  Phase 1: Core Mathematical Tools

  1. ✅ LaTeX compiler integration (COMPLETED)
  2. ✅ Theorem extraction and parsing (COMPLETED)
  3. Mathematical symbol conversion
  4. Bibliography management

  Phase 2: Proof Assistant Integration

  1. Lean theorem prover support
  2. Coq integration
  3. Proof verification workflows
  4. Tactic suggestion system

  Phase 3: Advanced Features

  1. Mathematical notation rendering
  2. Dependency graph visualization
  3. Automated proof search
  4. Mathematical knowledge base

  Key Advantages

  The existing architecture provides:
  - Extensible tool system → Easy to add mathematical tools
  - Rich streaming interface → Real-time proof checking feedback
  - Memory persistence → Maintain mathematical context
  - Multi-modal support → Handle LaTeX, images, PDFs
  - MCP protocol → Integrate with existing math tools
  - Robust error handling → Graceful LaTeX compilation errors

  Conclusion

  The Gemini CLI architecture is exceptionally well-suited for mathematical workflows. The existing foundation provides:

  1. Flexible tool system for mathematical operations
  2. Rich terminal UI for displaying mathematical content
  3. Memory system for maintaining mathematical context
  4. Extensibility through MCP protocol
  5. Multi-modal support for various mathematical formats

  With the proposed enhancements, it would become a powerful environment for mathematical research, theorem development, and proof construction, while
  maintaining the safety and user-friendly aspects of the current system.

 Theorem Indexing Capabilities

  Key Features Added:

  Enhanced Indexing:
  - Theorem Index: Maps theorem labels to IDs, organizes by type, and creates symbol indices
  - Dependency Graph: Tracks which theorems depend on others through references
  - Relationship Mapping: Identifies theorem dependencies and dependents
  - Cyclic Dependency Detection: Warns about circular references between theorems

  Additional Data Structures:
  - IndexedTheorem: Extended theorem interface with indexing metadata
  - TheoremIndex: Comprehensive index structure with multiple lookup tables
  - TheoremIndexingResult: Enhanced result with dependency analysis

  Advanced Analysis:
  - Orphaned theorem detection (theorems with no dependencies/dependents)
  - Symbol usage tracking across theorems
  - Comprehensive dependency graph visualization
  - Statistical summaries with indexing metrics

  The new tool is registered as index_theorems and provides all the functionality of the original extract_theorems tool plus comprehensive indexing and relationship analysis capabilities.
